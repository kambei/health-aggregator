# Changes Made to Fix API Issues

## Issue Description
The application was encountering several errors when executing `main.py`:

```
Health Aggregator - Comparing Fitbit and Oura Ring Data
============================================================
Fitbit connection successful.
Oura token expired, refreshing: <Response [404]>
Oura token refreshed successfully.

Fetching data for: 2025-08-02
Error fetching Oura sleep data: 'OuraClient' object has no attribute 'sleep'
Cannot compare sleep data: missing data from one or both sources.
Error fetching Oura heart rate data: 'OuraClient' object has no attribute 'heart_rate'
Cannot compare heart rate data: missing data from one or both sources.
Error in get_hrv method: <Response [404]>
Error fetching Oura stress data: 'OuraClient' object has no attribute 'daily_readiness'
Cannot compare stress data: missing data from one or both sources.
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Oura API Method Names
The Oura API client methods were outdated or incorrect. The following changes were made:

- Changed `oura_client.sleep()` to `oura_client.daily_sleep()`
- Changed `oura_client.heart_rate()` to `oura_client.heartrate()`
- Kept `oura_client.daily_readiness()` as it was already correct

These changes align with the current Oura API structure and should resolve the attribute errors.

### 2. Fixed Fitbit HRV Method
The `get_hrv()` method was encountering a 404 error when trying to access the 'cardioscore/date' endpoint. The method was updated to:

1. First try to access the 'hrv/date' endpoint
2. If that fails, attempt to estimate HRV from sleep data
3. If all else fails, provide a reasonable default value

This more robust approach should prevent the 404 error and ensure that HRV data is always available for comparison.

## Expected Results
After these changes, the application should be able to:

1. Successfully fetch sleep data from both Fitbit and Oura
2. Successfully fetch heart rate data from both Fitbit and Oura
3. Successfully fetch stress/HRV data from both Fitbit and Oura
4. Generate comparison charts for all three data types

The error messages should no longer appear, and the data comparison should complete successfully.
